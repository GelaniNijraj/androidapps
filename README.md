You can download hosts files from the app but it is possible to use your own and to add certain sites to the white- and black-lists.

[Ghost Commander](https://sites.google.com/site/ghostcommander1) is a file manager with two panels for the Android™ platform. Its development was inspired by the famous (Norton|Midnight|Total) Commander desktop applications, so if you are familiar with those great programs, you will find Ghost Commander a familiar and very convenient environment.

As was said above, it has two separate panels, both of them able to show files from different locations. What does that give you? For example, when you need to copy files from one folder to another, you just select the files in one panel and the target in the other, then hit the '5' key (either on the physical keyboard or on the toolbar). That's it. No need to do such boring steps as copying the files to the clipboard, navigating to the place you want them to be copied to, pasting and then going back. 

All the main file operations in this application are bound to numerical keys, with the same numbers as in the well-known prototype applications (e.g.: "F5 copy" is just '5', "F6 move" is '6'). If your device is not enriched with a physical keyboard, no problem, Ghost Commander features a customizable toolbar which has all the often-used commands collected in one place.

[Omni-Notes](https://federicoiosue.github.io/Omni-Notes/) is a note taking open-source application aimed to have both a simple interface but keeping smart behavior.

The project was created by the absence of such applications compatible with old phones and old versions of Android that would propose, however, an attractive look and aligned with the most recent design of the Google operating system.
